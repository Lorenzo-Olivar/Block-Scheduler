# Block-Scheduler

## Description

My motivation in creating this project was to make a simple and easy-to-use block-style scheduler for the user to use in their daily lives.

I built this project to familiarize myself with the use of third-party APIs and their functions.

Thankfully, this scheduler helps with organizing an individual's busy life by assigning events and things to do at a specific time. 

Overall, I learned how beneficial it is to utilize third-party APIs to be more efficient when coding.

## Installation

Proceed to this link: [Block Scheduler](https://lorenzo-olivar.github.io/Block-Scheduler/)

## Usage

The time blocks automatically change colors (GRAY = Past / RED = Present / GREEN = Future) based on the current time

AND

all you have to do is type in the time block boxes and save your events by clicking on the button to the right of the time block
