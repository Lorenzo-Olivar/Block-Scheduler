# Block-Scheduler

## Description

As a developer,

I wanted to create a block-style scheduler that is saved to your local device and displays the current day,

So that users can use this application to schedule their time effectively and reference back to the scheduler if they close the web application out.

## Installation

Proceed to this link: [Block Scheduler]()

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
